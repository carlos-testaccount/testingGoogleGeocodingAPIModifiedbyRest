        <td class="legend_description">
          cuke_sniffer is an open source project with the goal of aiding others in the maintenance and improvement of their cucumber projects. This tool will identify improvements for readability, misuse of cucumber practices, and point out step definitions that are no longer used (dead steps).

          Scoring:
        </td>
        <td class="legend_description">
          The higher the score the more improvements there are to be made. The score ultimately is unique to the project since projects can vary so much from domain, number of people involved, and how long the project has been around. We suggest that you use it as a measure against yourself as you move forward and make improvements.

There are also measures used to do fuzzy matching in the case of step definitions that are only ever called through constructed calls.
          This section is divided up by step definition file to more easily find/remove the unused step definition. We show the line and regex of each dead step.
